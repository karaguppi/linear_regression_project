# Linear Regression Example 
This project is an example of how linear regression works in the simplest form. We have a dataset from an ecommerce website and we will be using 
Linear regression model to make predictions on what aspect of the data can contribute to more sales i.e. more ammount spent by the customer 
on the website. 

# Methodlogy 
1. The data has already been cleaned and is available to use instantly. 
2. Investigate the data by doing some exploratory data analysis and check for relationships between different metrics. 
3. Load the train_test_split model from scikit-learn and provide it with predictions as well as target points. 
4. Use linear regression model to make the predictions. 
5. Calculate error rates after the predictions are made to check how well the model performed. 
6. Lastly, check for residuals and if there is a normal distribution curve. 


At all points we will be using seaborn to plot the relevant metrics and ensure we are on the right track. 

At the end, we will make a prediction based on the coefficients from our model run. 

# High level view of the data available:
-Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
-Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
-Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
-Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. Note that all the personal information is not real.
